Like the PowerShell Roguelite, I've decided to reinvent this in Python instead. The PowerShell one was quickly getting out of hand due to the constraints of PowerShell being utilised in a way it's not supposed to be.

### Plan for this Project:

- Add Multiplayer
- Monitor using tools like Grafana
- Learn more Python and use plugins like Flask etc.
